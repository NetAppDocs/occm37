Get started with Cloud Volumes ONTAP by setting up GCP and then deploying Cloud Manager software from NetApp Cloud Central.

Note the following before you get started:

* Cloud Manager must be installed in Google Cloud Platform in order to deploy Cloud Volumes ONTAP in GCP.
* The only way to deploy Cloud Manager in GCP is from NetApp Cloud Central.

=== image:number1.png[Number 1] Set up your networking

[role="quick-margin-para"]
Enable outbound internet access from the target VPC so Cloud Manager and Cloud Volumes ONTAP can contact several endpoints.

[role="quick-margin-para"]
This step is important because Cloud Manager can't deploy Cloud Volumes ONTAP without outbound internet access. If you need to limit outbound connectivity, refer to the list of endpoints for link:reference_networking_cloud_manager.html#outbound-internet-access[Cloud Manager] and link:reference_networking_gcp.html[Cloud Volumes ONTAP].

=== image:number2.png[Number 2] Set up GCP for data tiering

[role="quick-margin-para"]
A few steps are required if you want to tier cold data from Cloud Volumes ONTAP to low-cost object storage (a Google Cloud Storage bucket):

[role="quick-margin-list"]
.. https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/configure-private-google-access[Configure the Cloud Volumes ONTAP subnet for Private Google Access^].

.. https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-accounts#creating_a_service_account[Create a service account that has the predefined Storage Admin role^].

.. Go to your https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/settings[GCP Storage Settings^] and create access keys for the service account:
+
* Select a project, and click *Interoperability*. If you haven’t already done so, click *Enable interoperability access*.
* Under *Access keys for service accounts*, click *Create a key for a service account*, select the service account that you just created, and click *Create Key*.
+
You'll need to link:task_adding_gcp_accounts.html[add the keys to Cloud Manager] later so it can use them to manage a Cloud Storage bucket for data tiering.

=== image:number3.png[Number 3] Enable Google Cloud APIs

[role="quick-margin-para"]
https://cloud.google.com/apis/docs/getting-started#enabling_apis[Enable the following Google Cloud APIs in your project^]. These APIs are required to deploy Cloud Manager and Cloud Volumes ONTAP.

[role="quick-margin-list"]
* Cloud Deployment Manager V2 API
* Cloud Resource Manager API
* Compute Engine API
* Stackdriver Logging API

[[service-account]]
=== image:number4.png[Number 4] Set up GCP permissions and projects

[role="quick-margin-para"]
Make sure that two sets of permissions are in place:

[role="quick-margin-list"]
.. Ensure that the GCP user who deploys Cloud Manager from NetApp Cloud Central has the permissions in the https://occm-sample-policies.s3.amazonaws.com/Setup_As_Service_3.7.3_GCP.yaml[Cloud Central policy for GCP^].
+
https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-custom-roles#iam-custom-roles-create-gcloud[You can create a custom role using the YAML file^] and then attach it to the user. You'll need to use the gcloud command line to create the role.

.. Set up a service account that has the permissions that Cloud Manager needs to create and manage Cloud Volumes ONTAP systems in projects.
+
You'll associate this service account with the Cloud Manager VM in step 6. This service account is different from the service account that's used for data tiering.
+
* https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-custom-roles#iam-custom-roles-create-gcloud[Create a role in GCP^] that includes the permissions defined in the https://occm-sample-policies.s3.amazonaws.com/Policy_for_Cloud_Manager_3.7.4_GCP.yaml[Cloud Manager policy for GCP^]. Again, you'll need to use the gcloud command line.
+
The permissions contained in this YAML file are different than the permissions in step 4a.

* https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-accounts#creating_a_service_account[Create a GCP service account and apply the custom role that you just created^].

* If you want to deploy Cloud Volumes ONTAP in other projects, https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/granting-changing-revoking-access#granting-console[grant access by adding the service account with the Cloud Manager role to that project^]. You'll need to repeat this step for each project.

=== image:number5.png[Number 5] Subscribe from the GCP Marketplace

[role="quick-margin-para"]
https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/details/netapp-cloudmanager/cloud-manager[Subscribe to Cloud Volumes ONTAP from the GCP Marketplace^] to ensure that there’s no disruption of service after your free trial ends. You’ll be charged from this subscription for every Cloud Volumes ONTAP PAYGO system that you create.

=== image:number6.png[Number 6] Launch Cloud Manager from NetApp Cloud Central

[role="quick-margin-para"]
Cloud Manager software is required to deploy and manage Cloud Volumes ONTAP. It takes just a few minutes to launch a Cloud Manager instance in GCP from https://cloud.netapp.com[Cloud Central^]. Cloud Manager must be installed in GCP from Cloud Central before you can deploy Cloud Volumes ONTAP.

[role="quick-margin-para"]
When you choose GCP as the cloud provider, you're prompted by Google to log in to your account and to grant permissions. Clicking "Allow" grants access to the compute APIs needed to deploy Cloud Manager.

=== image:number7.png[Number 7] Launch Cloud Volumes ONTAP using Cloud Manager

[role="quick-margin-para"]
Once Cloud Manager is ready, just click Create, select the type of system that you would like to deploy, and complete the steps in the wizard. After 25 minutes, your first Cloud Volumes ONTAP system should be up and running.

Watch the following video for a walk through of these steps:
