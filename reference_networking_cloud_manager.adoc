[.lead]
Set up your networking so that Cloud Manager can deploy Cloud Volumes ONTAP systems in AWS, Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud Platform. The most important step is ensuring outbound internet access to various endpoints.

TIP: If your network uses a proxy server for all communication to the internet, Cloud Manager prompts you to specify the proxy during setup. You can also specify the proxy server from the Settings page. Refer to link:task_configuring_proxy.html[Configuring Cloud Manager to use a proxy server].

== Connection to target networks

Cloud Manager requires a network connection to the VPCs and VNets in which you want to deploy Cloud Volumes ONTAP.

For example, if you install Cloud Manager in your corporate network, then you must set up a VPN connection to the VPC or VNet in which you launch Cloud Volumes ONTAP.

== Outbound internet access

Cloud Manager requires outbound internet access to deploy and manage Cloud Volumes ONTAP. Outbound internet access is also required when accessing Cloud Manager from your web browser and when running the Cloud Manager installer on a Linux host.

The following sections identify the specific endpoints.

=== Endpoints accessed from your web browser
Users must access Cloud Manager from a web browser. The machine running the web browser must have connections to the following endpoints:

[cols="43,57",options="header"]
|===
| Endpoints
| Purpose
|
The Cloud Manager host

a| You must enter the host's IP address from a web browser to load the Cloud Manager console.

Depending on your connectivity to your cloud provider, you can use the private IP or a public IP assigned to the host:

- A private IP works if you have a VPN and direct connect access to your virtual network
- A public IP works in any networking scenario

In any case, you should secure network access by ensuring that security group rules allow access from only authorized IPs or subnets.

|
\https://auth0.com
\https://cdn.auth0.com
\https://netapp-cloud-account.auth0.com
\https://services.cloud.netapp.com

| Your web browser connects to these endpoints for centralized user authentication through NetApp Cloud Central.
