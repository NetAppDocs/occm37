The Privacy Risk Assessment Report provides an overview of your organizationâ€™s privacy risk status, as required by privacy regulations such as GDPR and CCPA.

NOTE: NetApp can't guarantee 100% accuracy of the personal data and sensitive personal data that Cloud Compliance identifies. You should always validate the information by reviewing the data.

The report includes the following information:

Compliance status:: A severity score (see below for more details) and the distribution of data, whether it's non-sensitive, personal, or sensitive personal.

Assessment overview:: A breakdown of the types of personal data found, as well as the categories of data.

Data subjects in this assessment:: The number of people by location for which national identifiers were found.

Cloud Compliance generates a PDF report that you can review and send to other groups as needed.

== Severity score

Cloud Compliance calculates the severity score for the Privacy Risk Assessment Report on the basis of three variables:

* The percentage of personal data out of all data.
* The percentage of sensitive personal data out of all data.
* The percentage of files that include data subjects, determined by national identifiers such as national IDs, Social Security numbers, and tax ID numbers.

The logic used to determine the score is as follows:
