Cloud Manager enables you to discover the NFS cloud volumes in your https://cloud.netapp.com/cloud-volumes-service-for-aws[Cloud Volumes Service for AWS^] subscription. After discovery, you can add additional NFS cloud volumes directly from Cloud Manager.

NOTE: Cloud Manager does not support SMB or dual-protocol volumes with Cloud Volumes Service for AWS.

== Before you get started

* Cloud Manager enables discovery of _existing_ Cloud Volumes Service for AWS subscriptions. See the https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/cloud_volumes/aws/media/cvs_aws_account_setup.pdf[NetApp Cloud Volumes Service for AWS Account Setup Guide^] if you haven't set up your subscription yet.
+
You must follow this setup process for each region and provision your first volume from Cloud Volumes Service before you can discover the region in Cloud Manager.

* You need to obtain the Cloud Volumes API key and secret key so you can provide them to Cloud Manager. https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/cloud_volumes/aws/reference_cloud_volume_apis.html#finding-the-api-url-api-key-and-secret-key[For instructions, refer to Cloud Volumes Service for AWS documentation^].

== Discovering your Cloud Volumes Service for AWS subscription

To get started, you need to discover the cloud volumes in an AWS region. You can discover additional regions later.

.Steps

. On the Working Environments page, click *Discover*.

. Select *Cloud Volumes Service for AWS*.
+

. Provide information about your Cloud Volumes Service subscription:

.. Select the AWS region where your cloud volumes reside.
.. Enter the Cloud Volumes API key and secret key. https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/cloud_volumes/aws/reference_cloud_volume_apis.html#finding-the-api-url-api-key-and-secret-key[For instructions, refer to Cloud Volumes Service for AWS documentation^].
.. Click *Go*.
+

== Discovering additional regions

If you have cloud volumes in additional regions, you need to discover each individual region.

.Steps

. On the Working Environments page, select the working environment (but don't open it by double-clicking).

. In the right pane, click *Discover Cloud Volumes Service in another region*.
+

. Provide information about your Cloud Volumes Service subscription:

.. Select the AWS region where your cloud volumes reside.
.. Enter the Cloud Volumes API key and secret key. https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/cloud_volumes/aws/reference_cloud_volume_apis.html#finding-the-api-url-api-key-and-secret-key[For instructions, refer to Cloud Volumes Service for AWS documentation^].
.. Click *Go*.

.Result

Cloud Manager discovers information about the cloud volumes in the selected region.

== Creating cloud volumes

Cloud Manager enables you to create NFSv3 cloud volumes. You can only create cloud volumes with an initial size and single export policy. Editing the volume must be done from the Cloud Volume Service user interface.

. Open the working environment.

. Click *Add New Volume*.

. Enter details about the volume:

.. Enter a name for the volume.
.. Specify a size within the range of 100 GiB to 90,000 GiB (equivalent to 88 TiBs).
+
NOTE: Cloud Manager displays volumes in GiB, while the Cloud Volumes Service displays volumes in GB.

.. Specify a service level: Standard, Premium, or Extreme.
+
https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/cloud_volumes/aws/reference_selecting_service_level_and_quota.html#service-levels[Learn more about these service levels^].
.. Choose a region. You can create the volume in a region that Cloud Manager has discovered.
.. Restrict client access by specifying an IP address or Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR).

== Getting help

Use the Cloud Manager chat for general service questions.

For technical support issues associated with your cloud volumes, use your 20 digit “930” serial number located in the "Support" tab of the Cloud Volumes Service user interface. Use this support ID when opening a web ticket or calling for support. Be sure to activate your Cloud Volumes Service serial number for support from the Cloud Volumes Service user interface. https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/cloud_volumes/aws/task_activating_support_entitlement.html[Those steps are explained here^].

== Limitations

* Cloud Manager does not support SMB or dual-protocol volumes.

* You can only create cloud volumes with an initial size and single export policy. Editing the volume must be done from the Cloud Volume Service user interface.

* Cloud Manager doesn't support data replication to or from a Cloud Volumes Service for AWS subscription.

* Removing your Cloud Volumes Service for AWS subscription from Cloud Manager isn't supported. There are no charges to discover a region from Cloud Manager.
