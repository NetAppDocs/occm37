View and create NFS volumes for https://cloud.netapp.com/azure-netapp-files[Azure NetApp Files^] directly from Cloud Manager.

== Setting up your configuration

Your configuration needs to meet a few requirements before you can manage volumes for Azure NetApp Files from Cloud Manager.

. Azure NetApp Files must be set up by completing the following from the Azure portal:

* https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-netapp-files/azure-netapp-files-register[Register for Azure NetApp Files^]
* https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-netapp-files/azure-netapp-files-create-netapp-account[Create a NetApp account^]
* https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-netapp-files/azure-netapp-files-set-up-capacity-pool[Set up a capacity pool^]
* https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-netapp-files/azure-netapp-files-delegate-subnet[Delegate a subnet to Azure NetApp Files^]

. Cloud Manager must be set up as follows:

* Cloud Manager must be running in Azure, in the account where Azure NetApp Files was set up.

* The Cloud Manager virtual machine must receive permissions through a https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview[managed identity^].
+
If you deployed Cloud Manager from Cloud Central, then you're all set. Cloud Central automatically enables a system-assigned managed identity on the Cloud Manager virtual machine.
+
If you deployed Cloud Manager from the Azure Marketplace, then you should have followed link:task_launching_azure_mktp.html[instructions to enable a managed identity].

* The Azure role assigned to the Cloud Manager virtual machine must include the permissions listed in the latest https://occm-sample-policies.s3.amazonaws.com/Policy_for_cloud_Manager_Azure_3.7.4.json[Cloud Manager policy for Azure^]:
+
[source,json]
"Microsoft.NetApp/netAppAccounts/read",
"Microsoft.NetApp/netAppAccounts/capacityPools/read",
"Microsoft.NetApp/netAppAccounts/capacityPools/volumes/write",
"Microsoft.NetApp/netAppAccounts/capacityPools/volumes/read",
"Microsoft.NetApp/netAppAccounts/capacityPools/volumes/delete"

When your configuration is set up, Cloud Manager automatically displays Azure NetApp Files on the Working Environments page:
