A service account provides Cloud Manager with permissions to deploy and manage Cloud Volumes ONTAP systems in the same project as Cloud Manager, or in different projects. Google Cloud accounts that you add to Cloud Manager are used to enable data tiering.

== Project and permissions for Cloud Manager

Before you can deploy Cloud Volumes ONTAP in Google Cloud, you must first deploy Cloud Manager in a Google Cloud project. Cloud Manager can't be running on your premises, or in a different cloud provider.

Two sets of permissions must be in place before you deploy Cloud Manager from https://cloud.netapp.com[NetApp Cloud Central^]:

. You need to deploy Cloud Manager using a Google account that has permissions to launch the Cloud Manager VM instance from Cloud Central.

. When deploying Cloud Manager, you are prompted to select a https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/service-accounts[service account^] for the VM instance. Cloud Manager gets permissions from the service account to create and manage Cloud Volumes ONTAP systems on your behalf. Permissions are provided by attaching a custom role to the service account.

We have set up two YAML files that include the required permissions for the user and the service account. link:task_getting_started_gcp.html[Learn how to use the YAML files to set up permissions].

The following image depicts the permission requirements described in numbers 1 and 2 above:

== Project for Cloud Volumes ONTAP

Cloud Volumes ONTAP can reside in the same project as Cloud Manager, or in a different project. To deploy Cloud Volumes ONTAP in a different project, you need to first add the Cloud Manager service account and role to that project.

== Account for data tiering

Adding a Google Cloud account to Cloud Manager is required to enable data tiering on a Cloud Volumes ONTAP system. Data tiering automatically tiers cold data to low-cost object storage, enabling you to reclaim space on your primary storage and shrink secondary storage.

When you add the account, you need to provide Cloud Manager with a storage access key for a service account that has Storage Admin permissions. Cloud Manager uses the access keys to set up and manage a Cloud Storage bucket for data tiering.

After you add a Google Cloud account, you can then enable data tiering on individual volumes when you create, modify, or replicate them.
