Several offerings are available in the AWS Marketplace for Cloud Manager and Cloud Volumes ONTAP. If you're not sure which page you need to use, read below and we'll direct you to the right page based on your goal.

In all cases, remember that you can't launch Cloud Volumes ONTAP in AWS from the AWS Marketplace. You need to launch it directly from Cloud Manager.
