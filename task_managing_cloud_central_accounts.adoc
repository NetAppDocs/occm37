== Adding users

Associate Cloud Central users with the Cloud Central account so those users can create and manage working environments in Cloud Manager.

.Steps

. If the user has not already done so, ask the user to go to https://cloud.netapp.com[NetApp Cloud Central^] and create an account.

. In Cloud Manager, click *Account Settings*.

. In the Users tab, click *Associate User*.

. Enter the user's email address and select a role for the user:
+
* *Account Admin*: Can perform any action in Cloud Manager.
* *Workspace Admin*: Can create and manage resources in assigned workspaces.

. If you selected Workspace Admin, select one or more workspaces to associate with that user.

.Result

== Removing users

Disassociating a user makes it so they can no longer access the resources in a Cloud Central account.

.Steps

. Click *Account Settings*.

. Click the action menu in the row that corresponds to the user.

== Managing a Workspace Admin's workspaces

You can associate and disassociate Workspace Admins with workspaces at any time. Associating the user enables them to create and view the working environments in that workspace.

.Steps

. Click *Account Settings*.

. Click the action menu in the row that corresponds to the user.
+

. Click *Manage Workspaces*.

. Select the workspaces to associate with the user and click *Apply*.

.Result

The user can now access those workspaces from Cloud Manager, as long as the service connector was also associated with the workspaces.

== Managing workspaces

Manage your workspaces by creating, renaming, and deleting them. Note that you can't delete a workspace if it contains any resources. It must be empty.

.Steps

. Click *Account Settings*.

. Click *Workspaces*.

. Choose one of the following options:
+
* Click *Add New Workspace* to create a new workspace.
* Click *Rename* to rename the workspace.
* Click *Delete* to delete the workspace.

== Managing a service connector's workspaces

You need to associate the service connector with workspaces so Workspace Admins can access those workspaces from Cloud Manager.

If you only have Account Admins, then associating the service connector with workspaces isn't required. Account Admins have the ability to access all workspaces in Cloud Manager by default.
