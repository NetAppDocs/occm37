[.lead]
Get started with Cloud Volumes ONTAP by setting up AWS and then launching Cloud Manager software from NetApp Cloud Central. A 30-day free trial is available for the first Cloud Volumes ONTAP system that you launch in AWS.

=== image:number1.png[Number 1] Set up your networking

[role="quick-margin-list"]
.. Enable outbound internet access from the target VPC so Cloud Manager and Cloud Volumes ONTAP can contact several endpoints.
+
This step is important because Cloud Manager can't deploy Cloud Volumes ONTAP without outbound internet access. If you need to limit outbound connectivity, refer to the list of endpoints for link:reference_networking_cloud_manager.html#outbound-internet-access[Cloud Manager] and link:reference_networking_aws.html#general-aws-networking-requirements-for-cloud-volumes-ontap[Cloud Volumes ONTAP].

.. Set up a VPC endpoint to the S3 service.
+
A VPC endpoint is required if you want to tier cold data from Cloud Volumes ONTAP to low-cost object storage.

=== image:number2.png[Number 2] Provide the required AWS permissions

[role="quick-margin-para"]
When you deploy Cloud Manager from NetApp Cloud Central, you need to use an AWS account that has permissions to deploy the instance.

[role="quick-margin-list"]
.. Go to the AWS IAM console and create a policy by copying and pasting the contents of the https://mysupport.netapp.com/cloudontap/iampolicies[NetApp Cloud Central policy for AWS^].

.. Attach the policy to the IAM user.

=== image:number3.png[Number 3] Subscribe from the AWS Marketplace

[role="quick-margin-para"]
https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B07QX2QLXX[Subscribe to Cloud Manager from the AWS Marketplace^] to ensure that there's no disruption of service after your free trial of Cloud Volumes ONTAP ends. You'll be charged from this subscription for every Cloud Volumes ONTAP PAYGO system that you create and each add-on feature that you enable.

[role="quick-margin-para"]
If you're launching Cloud Volumes ONTAP by bringing your own license (BYOL), https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/search/results?x=0&y=0&searchTerms=cloud+volumes+ontap+byol[then you'll need to subscribe to that offering in the AWS Marketplace^].

=== image:number4.png[Number 4] Launch Cloud Manager from NetApp Cloud Central

[role="quick-margin-para"]
Cloud Manager software is required to deploy and manage Cloud Volumes ONTAP. It takes just a few minutes to launch a Cloud Manager instance from https://cloud.netapp.com[Cloud Central^].

=== image:number5.png[Number 5] Launch Cloud Volumes ONTAP using Cloud Manager

[role="quick-margin-para"]
Once Cloud Manager is ready, just click Create, select the type of system that you would like to launch, and complete the steps in the wizard. After 25 minutes, your first Cloud Volumes ONTAP system should be up and running.
