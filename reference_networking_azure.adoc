Set up your Azure networking so Cloud Volumes ONTAP systems can operate properly.

Outbound internet access for Cloud Volumes ONTAP::
Cloud Volumes ONTAP requires outbound internet access to send messages to NetApp AutoSupport, which proactively monitors the health of your storage.
+
Routing and firewall policies must allow HTTP/HTTPS traffic to the following endpoints so Cloud Volumes ONTAP can send AutoSupport messages:
+
* \https://support.netapp.com/aods/asupmessage
* \https://support.netapp.com/asupprod/post/1.0/postAsup

Security groups::
You do not need to create security groups because Cloud Manager does that for you. If you need to use your own, refer to link:reference_security_groups_azure.html[Security group rules].

Number of IP addresses::
Cloud Manager allocates the following number of IP addresses to Cloud Volumes ONTAP in Azure:

* Single node: 5 IP addresses
* HA pair: 16 IP addresses
+
Note that Cloud Manager creates an SVM management LIF on HA pairs, but not on single node systems in Azure.
+
TIP: A LIF is an IP address associated with a physical port. An SVM management LIF is required for management tools like SnapCenter.

Connection from Cloud Volumes ONTAP to Azure Blob storage for data tiering::
If you want to tier cold data to Azure Blob storage, you don't need to set up a connection between the performance tier and the capacity tier as long as Cloud Manager has the required permissions. Cloud Manager enables a VNet service endpoint for you if the Cloud Manager policy has these permissions:
+
[source,json]
"Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/subnets/write",
"Microsoft.Network/routeTables/join/action",
+
These permissions are included in the latest https://mysupport.netapp.com/cloudontap/iampolicies[Cloud Manager policy].
+
For details about setting up data tiering, see link:task_tiering.html[Tiering cold data to low-cost object storage].

Connections to ONTAP systems in other networks::
To replicate data between a Cloud Volumes ONTAP system in Azure and ONTAP systems in other networks, you must have a VPN connection between the Azure VNet and the other networkâ€”for example, an AWS VPC or your corporate network.
+
For instructions, refer to https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-howto-site-to-site-resource-manager-portal[Microsoft Azure Documentation: Create a Site-to-Site connection in the Azure portal^].
