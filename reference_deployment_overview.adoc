Before you get started, you might want to better understand your options for deploying Cloud Manager and Cloud Volumes ONTAP.

== Cloud Manager installation

Cloud Manager software is required to deploy and manage Cloud Volumes ONTAP. You can deploy Cloud Manager in any of the following locations:

* Amazon Web Services (AWS)
* Microsoft Azure
* Google Cloud Platform
+
Cloud Manager must be in Google Cloud Platform when deploying Cloud Volumes ONTAP in GCP.
* IBM Cloud
* In your own network

How you deploy Cloud Manager depends on which location you choose:
