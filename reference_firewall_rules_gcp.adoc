Cloud Manager creates GCP firewall rules that include the inbound and outbound rules that Cloud Manager and Cloud Volumes ONTAP need to operate successfully. You might want to refer to the ports for testing purposes or if you prefer your to use own security groups.

== Rules for Cloud Manager

The firewall rules for Cloud Manager requires both inbound and outbound rules.

=== Inbound rules for Cloud Manager

The source for inbound rules in the predefined firewall rules is 0.0.0.0/0.

[cols="10,10,80",width=100%,options="header"]
|===

| Protocol
| Port
| Purpose

| SSH | 22 | Provides SSH access to the Cloud Manager host
| HTTP | 80 |	Provides HTTP access from client web browsers to the Cloud Manager web console
| HTTPS |	443 |	Provides HTTPS access from client web browsers to the Cloud Manager web console

|===

=== Outbound rules for Cloud Manager

The predefined firewall rules for Cloud Manager opens all outbound traffic. If that is acceptable, follow the basic outbound rules. If you need more rigid rules, use the advanced outbound rules.

==== Basic outbound rules

The predefined firewall rules for Cloud Manager includes the following outbound rules.

[cols=3*,options="header",width=70%,cols="20,20,60"]
|===

| Protocol
| Port
| Purpose

| All TCP | All | All outbound traffic
| All UDP | All |	All outbound traffic

|===

==== Advanced outbound rules

If you need rigid rules for outbound traffic, you can use the following information to open only those ports that are required for outbound communication by Cloud Manager.

NOTE: The source IP address is the Cloud Manager host.
