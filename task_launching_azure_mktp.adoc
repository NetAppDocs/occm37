It is best to deploy Cloud Manager in Azure using https://cloud.netapp.com[NetApp Cloud Central^], but you can deploy it from the Azure Marketplace, if needed.

Separate instructions are available to deploy Cloud Manager in link:task_installing_azure_gov.html[Azure US Government regions] and in link:task_installing_azure_germany.html[Azure Germany regions].

TIP: If you deploy Cloud Manager from the Azure Marketplace, Cloud Manager is still integrated with NetApp Cloud Central. link:concept_cloud_central.html[Learn more about the integration].

== Deploying Cloud Manager in Azure

You need to install and set up Cloud Manager so you can use it to launch Cloud Volumes ONTAP in Azure.

.Steps

. https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/partners/netapp/netapp-oncommand-cloud-manager/[Go to the Azure Marketplace page for Cloud Manager^].

. Click *Get it now* and then click *Continue*.

. From the Azure portal, click *Create* and follow the steps to configure the virtual machine.
+
Note the following as you configure the VM:

* Cloud Manager can perform optimally with either HDD or SSD disks.

* Choose one of the recommended virtual machine sizes: A2, D2 v2, or D2 v3 (based on availability).

* For the network security group, Cloud Manager requires inbound connections using SSH, HTTP, and HTTPS.
+
link:reference_security_groups_azure.html[Learn more about security group rules for Cloud Manager].

* Under *Management*, enable *System assigned managed identity* for Cloud Manager by selecting *On*.
+
This setting is important because a managed identity allows the Cloud Manager virtual machine to identify itself to Azure Active Directory without providing any credentials. https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview[Learn more about managed identities for Azure resources^].

. On the *Review + create* page, review your selections and click *Create* to start the deployment.
+
Azure deploys the virtual machine with the specified settings. The virtual machine and Cloud Manager software should be running in approximately five minutes.

. Open a web browser from a host that has a connection to the Cloud Manager virtual machine and enter the following URL:
+
http://_ipaddress_:80

. After you log in, set up Cloud Manager:
.. Specify the Cloud Central account to associate with this Cloud Manager system.
+
link:concept_cloud_central_accounts.html[Learn about Cloud Central accounts].
.. Enter a name for the system.
+

.Result

Cloud Manager is now installed and set up. You must grant Azure permissions before users can deploy Cloud Volumes ONTAP in Azure.

== Granting Azure permissions to Cloud Manager

When you deployed Cloud Manager in Azure, you should have enabled a https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview[system-assigned managed identity^]. You must now grant the required Azure permissions by creating a custom role and then by assigning the role to the Cloud Manager virtual machine for one or more subscriptions.

.Steps

. Create a custom role using the Cloud Manager policy:

.. Download the https://mysupport.netapp.com/cloudontap/iampolicies[Cloud Manager Azure policy^].

.. Modify the JSON file by adding Azure subscription IDs to the assignable scope.
+
You should add the ID for each Azure subscription from which users will create Cloud Volumes ONTAP systems.
+
*Example*
+
"AssignableScopes": [
"/subscriptions/d333af45-0d07-4154-943d-c25fbzzzzzzz",
"/subscriptions/54b91999-b3e6-4599-908e-416e0zzzzzzz",
"/subscriptions/398e471c-3b42-4ae7-9b59-ce5bbzzzzzzz"

.. Use the JSON file to create a custom role in Azure.
+
The following example shows how to create a custom role using the Azure CLI 2.0:
+
*az role definition create --role-definition C:\Policy_for_cloud_Manager_Azure_3.7.4.json*
+
You should now have a custom role called OnCommand Cloud Manager Operator that you can assign to the Cloud Manager virtual machine.

. Assign the role to the Cloud Manager virtual machine for one or more subscriptions:

.. Open the *Subscriptions* service and then select the subscription in which you want to deploy Cloud Volumes ONTAP systems.

.. Click *Access control (IAM)*.

.. Click *Add* > *Add role assignment* and then add the permissions:

* Select the *OnCommand Cloud Manager Operator* role.
+
NOTE: OnCommand Cloud Manager Operator is the default name provided in the https://mysupport.netapp.com/info/web/ECMP11022837.html[Cloud Manager policy]. If you chose a different name for the role, then select that name instead.

* Assign access to a *Virtual Machine*.

* Select the subscription in which the Cloud Manager virtual machine was created.

* Select the Cloud Manager virtual machine.

* Click *Save*.

.. If you want to deploy Cloud Volumes ONTAP from additional subscriptions, switch to that subscription and then repeat these steps.

.Result

Cloud Manager now has the permissions that it needs to deploy and manage Cloud Volumes ONTAP in Azure.
